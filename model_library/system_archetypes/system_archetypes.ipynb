    "System Archtetypes are basic patterns of behaviour of a system. They arise in different guises in socio-economic systems such as enterprises and their ecosystems. Being able to identify these patterns is often a first step in finding leverage points for systemic improvements.\n",

No system property can grow indefinitely without being destroyed, so any reinforcing feedback loop must be keept in check by balancing loops. The limits to growth pattern is thus the combination of a reinforcing loop with a balancing loop."
