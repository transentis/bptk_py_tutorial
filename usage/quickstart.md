The best way to get started with the *Business Prototyping Toolkit for
Python* (BPTK-Py) is to download the BPTK-Py Tutorial. The tutorial
contains Jupyter notebooks and example models that illustrate how to use
the BPTK_Py framework to build models in Python System Dynamics,
agent-based modeling and how to transpile models in XMILE format.

You can clone or download the tutorial from our [git
repository](https://github.com/transentis/bptk_py_tutorial/) on Github.

The tutorial illustrates how to use the BPTK_PY framework, it contains
interactive Jupyter notebooks for each of the documents in this
documentation.

The tutorial and this documentation illustrate the framework using two
simulation models: the *Simple Project Management Model* and the
*Customer Acquisition* model.

-   *Simple Project Management Model*. This model is an illustration of
    [Parkinson\'s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law),
    which states that work expands so as to fill the time available for
    its completion.
-   *Customer Acquisition Model*. This model is an illustration of the
    [Bass Diffusion
    Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model) that
    describes the process of how new products get adopted in a
    population. The Bass model has been widely used in forecasting,
    especially in new products' sales forecasting and technology
    forecasting.

The logic of these models is not discussed in detail in this
documentation, you can read more about them on our blog:

-   The simple project management model is explained in our
    [Step-by-step introduction to System
    Dynamics](https://www.transentis.com/introduction-to-system-dynamics/en/).
-   The [Customer Acquisition
    Model](https://www.transentis.com/an-example-to-illustrate-the-business-prototyping-methodology/en/)
    is discussed in a series of blog posts illustrating the Business
    Prototyping Methodology.
