    "# Overview Of The BPTK-Py Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial contain sample agent-based and System Dynamics models along with Jupyter notebooks that illustrate the features of the BPTK-Py framework. This tutorial is designed as a companion to the [BPTK-Py online documentation](http://bptk.transentis-labs.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Docker installed (e.g. Docker Desktop on MacOS or on Windows), follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the command line, move into a directory where you would like to store the BPTK-Py tutorial. \n",
    "2. Clone this repository using git clone: ```git clone https://bitbucket.org/transentis/bptk_py_tutorial.git```\n",
    "3. Run ```docker-compose up```\n",
    "4. Point your browser at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) – this will open JupyterLab showing the contents of your directory. \n",
    "5. Open the notebook ```readme.ipynb``` from within JupyterLab.\n",
    "6. When you are finished, close your browser and call ```docker-compose down``` from within your directory. This will stop and remove the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the command line, move into a directory where you would like to store the BPTK-Py tutorial. \n",
    "2. Clone this repository using git clone: ```git clone https://bitbucket.org/transentis/bptk_py_tutorial.git```\n",
    "3. Install a virtual environment in that directory: ```python3 -m venv venv```\n",
    "4. Activate the virtual environment: ```source venv/bin/activate``` (MacOS/Linux) or ``venv\\scripts\\activate.bat``` (Windows)\n",
    "5. Install the necessary python modules: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```\n",
    "6. Start JupyerLab: ```jupyter lab```\n",
    "7. Your browser will open showing JupyterLab and your chosen directory\n",
    "8. Open the notebook ```readme.ipynb``` from within JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial contains quite a few noteboos and models. Which one to get started with depends on whether you are interested in System Dynamics using XMILE (e.g. Stella Architect or iThink), the System Dynamics DSL or Agent-based modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _SD with XMILE_ – start with [How To: Working With XMILE System Dynamics Models](how_to_working_with_XMILE.ipynb)\n",

    "* _Agent-based Modeling_ – start with [Agent-based Modeling with BPTK-Py](in_depth_agent_based_modeling.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate the BPTK-Py framework using three simple models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Simple Project Management Model__. This model is an illustration of [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law), which states that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. \n",
    "* __Bass Diffusion Model__. This model is an implementation of the [Bass diffusion model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model) originally created by [Frank Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Bass) that describes the process of how new products get adopted in a population. The Bass model has been widely used in forecasting, especially new products' sales forecasting and technology forecasting.\n",
    "* __Customer Acquisition Model__. A small model about referral marketing that builds upon the Bass Diffusion Model.\n",
